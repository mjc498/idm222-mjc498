        I share a home with two affectionate feline companions, Cal and Boots, both of
        whom are four years old. We welcomed these two loving brothers into our family
        after adopting them from a farm owned by my older sister's friend. Throughout 
        their transition from stray barn kittens to cuddly domestic cats, their silly 
        personalities never fail to bring joy and amusement into my family's daily
        routine.

        Born and raised in Northeast Philadelphia as part of a first generation immigrant
        household, I grew up surrounded by flavorful dishes. I love trying out new foods
        (especially cheap ones) at different spots around the city. I avidly live by the
        principle of never eating the same dish twice in a row when I visit an
        establishment more than once.
