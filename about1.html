    <p>
        I am a second-year undergraduate student at Drexel University, driven by a passion 
        for creativity, the intricacies of the mind, and the complexity of human behavior 
        through the lens of technology. I am a User Experience & Interactive Design (UXID) 
        major with a minor in Psychology.
    </p>
    <p>
        My introduction to Drexel's UXID program occurred during my initial co-op at Comcast
        Corporation, back when I was a pursuing a major in Psychology. While working at the 
        Comcast Technology Center, I encountered <i>The Universal Sphere</i> exhibition--
        an engaging and interactive cinematic experience open to the public. I later learned 
        that UXID co-op students contributed to this innovative exhibit, so I was intrigued 
        and sought further information. After thorough discussion with faculty at the Antoinette
        Westphal College of Media Arts and Design, I decided to take a gap semester before
        officially transitioning into my new major. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Drexel University mandates participation in the Co-Op program, a 6-month cooperative
        education initiative offering students invaluable professional work experience in
        diverse settings. This includes international, research, and entrepreneurial job 
        opportunities. I will be available for the next co-op cycle from April 2025 to September
        2025. I am eager to continue my journey of growth and exploration in the field of digital
        media.
